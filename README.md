# Penetration Testing Portfolio

This repository is part of my cybersecurity portfolio and showcases my hands‑on experience with penetration testing.

All work in this repository is performed entirely by me.  
No walkthroughs, no shortcuts. Where’s the fun in cheating? 😄

The uploads here serve as proof of:
- Practical experience
- Technical understanding
- Problem‑solving skills

This repository is primarily documentation of my learning process and my ability to approach, analyze, and exploit systems ethically.
